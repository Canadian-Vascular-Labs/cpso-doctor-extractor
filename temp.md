As a Software Developer specializing working to optimize healthcare workflows, am tasked with designing, building, and maintaining end-to-end applications that streamline data collection, processing, and presentation. You’ll work closely with clinical and IT stakeholders to integrate external APIs, manage backend databases, and develop custom tools that enhance efficiency within the Accuro EMR environment (main software used by the clinic for patient tracking, billing, scheduling, etc.)

Key Job Responsibilities

1. API Integration & Automation: Write and maintain automated scripts to interact with third-party RESTful APIs, handling authentication, error-handling, and rate-limiting (CS 458).
2. Full Stack Application Development: Architect and implement user-facing frontends (e.g. React) and backend services (e.g. Node.js/Python) that run periodic scripts to improve clinic efficiency.
3. Database Design & Maintenance: Design schemas, and indexing strategies; host and optimize relational or NoSQL databases (CS348) to store extracted data for advertising purposes.
4. Data Rendering & Visualization: Build components that query the backend and render data in tables, charts, and dashboards to support end-users in making data-driven decisions.
5. Workflow Optimization Tools: Develop and deploy custom tools and scripts that interface with the Accuro EMR sandbox/API to automate repetitive tasks (PDF merging, form submissions, faxing requisitions) and reduce manual overhead.
   Skills Required
6. Front-End Frameworks: Proficiency with modern JavaScript libraries and frameworks (e.g. React, Vue.js, or Angular) -- developed over previous coops (CANImmunize -- full stack engineer).
7. Back-End Development: Strong experience in Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for building RESTful services and server-side logic.
8. API & Automation: Deep understanding of RESTful API design, OAuth/JWT authentication flows, and scripting (e.g. Python, Bash) for automation.
9. GIT for source version control to develop and maintain software.
10. Security & Compliance: Awareness of data privacy regulations (e.g. PHIPA, HIPAA) and best practices for securing patient data (discussed in PD a few years ago).

This role is a logical next step because it lets me leverage proven platforms (Accuro, REST APIs, cloud-hosted databases) to build software that solves real clinical needs from day one. By delivering features that have an immediate impact on patient workflows, I’ll deepen my understanding of how these tools operate in live healthcare environments and sharpen my ability to turn existing solutions into practical, user-focused applications. That hands-on experience directly aligns with my goal of becoming a software developer who creates high-value, mission-critical software.
